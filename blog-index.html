          Teleworking Benefits
        </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Telework is an alternative work arrangement for employees. It allows
            employees to conduct some or all of their work at an alternative
            worksite away from the employer's typically used office.
            <em>Telework</em> is also referred to as
            <strong>telecommuting</strong>, <strong>flexiwork</strong>, and
            <strong>flexiplace</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3">Where ?</h3>
          <p>
            The telework concept can be applied to a variety of work
            environments. The work location might be: An employee's residence,a
            <u>Telework Center</u>,an airport, a coffee shop or any other
            location with connectivity to the internet.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3">Why?</h3>

          <p>
            Better performance
          </p>
          <p>
            Because telework allows operations to continue without disruption
            and reduces normal office distractions, most companies identified
            telework as a tool to increase productivity. They viewed telework as
            part of a broader effort to be an employer of choice or to meet
            compnies performance goals by creating conditions most conducive to
            productivity, such as allowing employees to adapt work conditions to
            meet their needs and work preferences. The metrics reported included
            employee performance ratings, data from the employee satisfaction
            and time and attendance records.
          </p>
          <p>Lower turnover</p>
          <p>
            Recruiting and training new employees takes time and is expensive.
            In some expensive areas like Seattle Downtown Area, telework allows
            employees to live in a less expensive neighborhood thatâ€™s farther
            away from the office when they otherwise would have had to change
            jobs and leave the companies. This allows employeers to retain
            talent and employees to reduce expenses associated with turnover.
            According to the OPM report, 75% of teleworkers said telework
            increased their desire to stay at their employers.
          </p>
          <p>Lower costs</p>
          <p>
            Many agencies save money on office space, energy use, and related
            purchases by having employees telework.
          </p>
          <p>Cleaner environment</p>
          <p>
            Telework helps agencies conserve energy and reduces the number of
            vehicles on the roads, hence less traffic, gas consumption, and
            pollution.
