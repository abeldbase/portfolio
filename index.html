        <article>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            My name is Abel Mengstu and I am a cashier at Walgreens Pharmacy. I
            am studying data analytics and database at Seattle central college,
            and plan to change my carrier to IT. I enjoy using my basic skills
            to contribute to my study and technological knowledge I get every
            day. My philosophy is ,every skill has a room in the world so learn
            something anytme and develop skills from your daily life.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As a cashier in downtown, I am the last face and sometimes the only
            face the customer sees, I will have to answer questions, explain
            store policy, and cope with customers irritated by long lines or
            other issues by maintaining a friendly approach and professional
            manner. For serious problems, I will probably be able to call a
            manager or customer service representative. Especially working in
            Downtown Seattle is not an easy business but changing all the
            challenges we face every day, every moment to the positive side of
            life and learning something out it is moving forward. It is a big
            and lifetime asset for me working downtown! I always tell myself if
            I can do this, I can do anything anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            After completing my studies, I need to become data analyst. Data has
            changed the face of our world over the last ten years. The numerous
            emails, text messages we share, YouTube videos we watch are part of
            the nearly 2.5 quintillion bytes of data generated daily across the
            world. Businesses, both large and small, deal with massive data
            volumes, and a lot depends on their ability to glean meaningful
            insights from them. A data analyst does precisely that. They
            interpret statistical data and turn it into useful information that
            businesses and organizations can use for critical
            decision-making.Besides the required professional skills in the
            filed my communication Skills, interpersonal Skills, people Skills
            and technology/Software knowledge , web development skills are an
            assets that I have.
