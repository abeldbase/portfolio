        <article>
          <p>
            My name is Abel Mengstu and I am a cashier at Walgreens Pharmacy. I
            am studying front end development at
            <strong>University of Washington</strong> , and plan to change my
            carrier to <em>IT</em>. I enjoy using my basic skills to contribute
            to my study and technological knowledge I get every day. My
            philosophy is ,every skill has a room in the world and learn
            something from your daily life.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a <em>cashier</em> in <strong>downtown</strong>, I am the last
            face and sometimes the only face the customer sees, I will have to
            answer <em>questions</em>, explain store policy, and cope with
            customers irritated by long lines or other issues, all while
            maintaining a friendly, professional manner. For serious problems, I
            will probably be able to call the <em>manager</em> or
            <em>customer service representative</em>. Especially working in
            Downtown Seattle is not easy but changing all the challenges we face
            every day every moment to the positive side of life and learning out
            it. It is a <em>big</em> and lifetime asset for me working in
            downtown! I always tell myself if I can do this, I can do
            <em>anything</em> anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing my study, I need to become front end web developer.
            Front end web developer plays an active role in the business’s key
            website development. He oversees frontend development for the
            business’s websites and platforms by building sitemaps, prototypes,
            wire frames, and conducting the documentation that articulates the
            sites’ structures and organization. I am learning all the required
            skills to implement any requested <em>template</em>,
            <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>CSS</em>. <em>Beside</em> my
            professional skills I get from my studies my communication Skills,
            interpersonal Skills, people Skills and technology ,Software
            knowldge are <em>assets</em> that I have.
