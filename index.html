      <h2 class="first subheader">A little about me!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Abel Mengstu and I am a cashier at Walgreens Pharmacy. I am
        studying front end development at
        <strong>University of Washington</strong> , and plan to change my
        carrier to <em>IT</em>. I enjoy using my basic skills to contribute to
        my study and technological knowledge I get every day. My philosophy is
        ,every skill has a room in the world and learn something from your daily
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <em>cashier</em> in <strong>downtown</strong>, I am the last face
        and sometimes the only face the customer sees, I will have to answer
        <em>questions</em>, <strong>explain store policy</strong>, and cope with
        customers irritated by long lines or other issues, all while maintaining
        a friendly, professional manner. For serious problems, I will probably
        be able to call the <em>manager</em> or
        <em>customer service representative</em>. Especially working in Downtown
        Seattle is not easy but changing all the challenges we face every day
        every moment to the positive side of life and learning out it. It is a
        <em>big</em> and lifetime asset for me working in downtown! I always
        tell myself if I can do this, I can do <em>anything</em> anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing my study, I need to become front end web developer.
        Front end web developer plays an active role in the business’s key
        website development. He oversees frontend development for the business’s
        websites and platforms by building sitemaps, prototypes, wire frames,
        and conducting the documentation that articulates the sites’ structures
        and organization. I am learning all the required skills to implement any
        requested <em>template</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>CSS</em>.
        <em>Beside</em> my professional skills I get from my studies my
        communication Skills, interpersonal Skills, people Skills and technology
        ,Software knowldge are <em>assets</em> that I have.
